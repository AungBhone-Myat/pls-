                        <p>Its been exactly 35 days that we've been talking to each other. I'm glad we met. I'm glad we talked. I'm glad we became something that we are right now. I feel like this is the right day to ask you properly to be my girlfriend. I will not let you down in any circumstances and as a man of my words I promise to not walk out with any shameless ways:thus may treat you the best I could as well. So may I ABM ask you respectfully to accept my proposal?
